## The "text hand" (hand of the *Iliad* text) ##

(Team B)

Evidence within the Venetus A manuscript suggests that one scribe the main text, the main scholia and the intermarginal scholia, albeit at different times. In composing the main text, the scribe additionally added breathing marks, accents, apostrophes for elision, the titles of each book, and among other things many of the interlinear scholia. The connection of one hand for both the main text and interlinear scholia can be deduced from the similarity of both the thickness and color of the pen. What follows are examples of various interlinear scholia made by the text-hand divided into three different categories: Corrections, Omitted Lines that are then added, and Completed Elisions.
