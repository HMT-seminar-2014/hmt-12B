## The "text hand" (hand of the *Iliad* text) ##

Evidence within the Venetus A manuscript suggests that one scribe composed the main text, the main scholia, intermarginal scholia, and interlinear scholia, albeit at different times. When composing the main text, the scribe not only added breathing marks, accents, apostrophes for elision, the titles of each book, among other things, but also composed much of the interlinear scholia. This connection between the main text and many of the interlinear scholia can be deduced from the similarity of both the thickness and color of the pen. What follows are examples of the types of  interlinear scholia that were made by the same hand that created the main text. The examples are divided into three different categories: Corrections, Omitted Lines that are then added, and Completed Elisions.

Thus these types of interlinear scholia appear to be composed at the same time as the main text. Very few exceptions exist where the interlinear scholia appear to be composed at the same time as the main scholia:
{141V 11.219}[ElisionText9] !{141V}[ElisionImage9] 
{158r 12.176}[ElisionText10] !{158r}[ElisionImage10]

Also line 199 of book 12 appears to be in the same hand of the Main Scholia:

{Lines 198 and 200}[AddedText1]- !{158r}[AddedImage1]
{Line 199}[AddedText2] - !{158r}[AddedImage2]

 For the most part though, once the scribe began work on the main scholia, he did not appear to return to the area dominated by the main text.
