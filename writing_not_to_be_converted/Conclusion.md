Allen hypothesizes that the Venetus A was created in multiple passes, with the same scribe composing the different sets of scholia at different times. Specifically, he notes how the interlinear scholia were composed separately from the main scholia. Our problematic examples, highlighting the apparent disconnect between the critical marks and the interlinear scholia, support Allen's hypothesis of multiple passes. Going beyond this, our examples suggest the possibility of a second source of Artistarchan commentary, one for the main scholia, and one for the interlinear. While it is hard to prove this definitively with just ne folio of the mansucript, we believe that further research into the idea across the entire document might yield promising results that the scribe had on hand different sources of Aristrachan criticism.
